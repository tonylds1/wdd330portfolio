              pushState and replaceState Parameters (state, title, path) the

            <p>
              the history API is just session history manipulation. if the page
              reloads, a new document is created and the history APi is lost.

              <p>
                I am concerned about the explanation says what the browsers do
                or if all that aork about history API using the methods needs to
                be done by the developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                What is the attribute that begins with 'data-' (like data-app)?
                I have saw a lot but did not find any documentation. Is it a
                convencion?
              </p>
