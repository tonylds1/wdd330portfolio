              Parts of a JWT:
              <u>

                <li>Payload</li>

            <p>
              <b>IMPORTANT</b>the signature and base64 are important items to
              prevent from atacks like the "man-in-the-middle"
            </p>
            <p>
              JWT allow granular security, that is the ability to specify a
              particular set of permissions in the token, wich improves
              debuggability

            <h3>About the Tech Talk about at sitepoint</h3>
            <p>
              I have listen to the talk more than 5 times and yet it was not
              clear to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              That seemed that the presenter was talking about our evolution and
              how important it is to have documentation closer to where we need
              it (the IDEs).
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, the presenter talks about usability and I made a research
              about how to improve the acessibility of a site.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thoght it was interesting that the presenter delineate how the
              amount of options make the developers confused.

        <p>
          it would be useful if someone could explain the talk better. I think I
          misunderstood it as a whole.
