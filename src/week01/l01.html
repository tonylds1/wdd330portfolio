                I had problems to make github works for two accounts. I tryied
                follow
                <a
                  href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574"
                  >this solution</a
                >
                but it does not worked as I thought. The solution is to use the
                primary one by sharing it with both accounts.
